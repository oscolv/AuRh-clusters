# Au-Rh clusters

Crystal structure predictions of global minimum for each bimetallic Au<sub>m</sub>Rh<sub>n</sub> cluster (m + n = 13), including Au<sub>13</sub> and Rh<sub>13</sub>, were performed using the USPEX code, based on an evolutionary algorithm. The total energy obtained at the PBE/PAW level of theory with VASP was the criterion used for the survival of the fittest structure. The ground state was determined for each of the 14 different molar concentrations of the Auâ€“Rh clusters. The 20 most stable structures are presented in XYZ format for each concentration.
